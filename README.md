# magmas.js: abstract algebra playground

nothing works here yet. but it might get there eventually.

## roadmap

1. create a set of elements with (binary) operations defined upon them. evaluate terms according to the operation.
2. match algebraic properties
	* using variables, equalities an quantors (unicode..?)
	* more logic?

## advanced features (maybe)

3. find properties in given operators via search (?)
4. generate operators from properties (??)
